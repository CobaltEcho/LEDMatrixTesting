# LEDMatrixTesting
## Parts and Pieces
1.  Arduino Nano Every
2.  WS2812B LED's

## Plan
* Currently in a 7 (width) x 5 (height) array for initial testing
* Will be exspanded to 14x10 once my LED's arrive

## What For?
* Designed for a Non-Profit Toys for Tots fishing tournament.  With 60+ boats on the water it's hard to hear when your number is called out (so you can launch off/go).  The original sign was made with 12v trailer tail lights and relays to make a two-digit 7-segment sign.  While the sign works well, it's time to take it up a notch!
* The plan is to have the original capability of the original 7-segment sign, plus to be able to show cool light shows, show a flag during the national anthem, and so on.

## Special Thanks / Contributors
* Reddit u/bu22ed - For teaching me that 'if' statements and switch() don't work well together and should be separated.
